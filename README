# Customer Segmentation

This repository holds some data and Notebook with a small customer segmentation exercise.

While this was done as an exercise for a company, the name has been removed (though it isn't difficult to find out which company it is).

The libraries required to run the Notebooks are:

 - pandas
 - numpy
 - nltk
 - sci-kit learn
 - jupyter
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
