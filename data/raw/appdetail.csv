Once it unpacks it gains advanced defense (like hunker) reducing damage taken and allowing it to fire. The primary cannon has a slow rate of fire, with a long charge up, but does incredible damage (potentially knocking down multiple shields with a single shot)<br>							   </li><li><strong>UEF Field Engineer: Mobile Repair and Support Unit</strong>: The UEF Mobile Repair and Support unit is a mobile engineer that has a basic direct fire turret as well as a repair arm. It is unable to build new structures, reclaim or capture, so its strength lies in its ability to accompany and quickly repair nearby allied units.<br>							   </li><li><strong>UEF Research Converter: Research Conversion Facility</strong>: This structure provides the option to generate Research directly from accumulated mass. It is highly inefficient, but produces an instant boost to research.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Illuminate Sooprizer: Experimental Gunship</strong>: The Illuminate Mega-Gunship offers a devastating direct-fire alternative to the Darkenoid. It does not have any anti-air capabilities focusing on ground based damage and increased survivability against surface threats.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Illuminate Illuminator: Experimental Intel Gathering Station</strong>: The Overhorizon Radar provides flawless Vision and Radar in a huge radius. However, it has a tremendous energy cost to activate, and a long cooldown period.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Illuminate Buhbledow: Experimental Shield Destroyer</strong>: The Shield Smasher is a ballistic EMP missile designed to knock down all enemy shields in a wide area.

The blast does insignificant damage to structures and units.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Illuminate Shotja: Sniper Bot</strong>: The sniper unit is a medium ranged, mobile hover unit. It has a single, high damage shot with a long cooldown. Its weakness is its low rate of fire and slow movement speed.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Cybran Recycler: Mass Reclaimer</strong>: Similar to the Loyalty Gun, the Mass Reclaimer has a medium range and automatically reclaims nearby wreckage. It is unable to reclaim living units, however.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Cybran Cicada: Experimental Cloak Generator</strong>: The Cicada is a mobile mini-experimental that, when activated, hides all units nearby from both vision and radar. This makes the units completely invisible to an opponent. The Cicada has a high energy cost which lasts for less than a minute before recharging. The complex unit lacks only the ability to cloak itself while in operation.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Cybran Intellitron: Air Scout</strong>: Lightly armored and unarmed, but with advanced vision and radar. Allows for quickly scouting remote areas of the map. Very fast to outrun anti-air.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Cybran Boomerang: Nuclear Missile Defense</strong>: This structure is placed in a base to defend against nukes. When incoming nukes get in range, they are reprogrammed and sent back to their origin. It has a low rate of fire and can be overwhelmed. Redirected nukes spoof enemy Anti-Nukes, making this a deadly structure to overlook when scouting for Nuke targets.<br>						</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Research Boosts/Upgrades</h2>						<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Research is focused on diversifying the factions while maintaining each faction's identity.<br>						</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">UEF</h2>						<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Naval Transportation<br>									<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>This naval tree upgrade allows experimental transports to carry naval units.<br>									</li></ul></li><li><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Speed overdrive<br>									<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>This short duration ability gives select land units a burst of speed for an energy cost.<br>									</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boost</strong>: ACU Veterancy Rate Increase<br>							   </li><li><strong>Boost</strong>: Structure Build cost for ACU: decreases cost of structures for ACU.<br>							   </li><li><strong>Boost</strong>: Structure Regeneration<br>						</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Illuminate</h2>						<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Upgrade</strong> - Tank Torpedo weapon<br>									<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Adds a torpedo weapon to the Illuminate tank, allowing it to hit submarines or other naval units from a distance while on water.<br>									</li></ul></li><li><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Structure Sacrifice<br>									<ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Adds an ability to all structures, allowing it to be sacrificed.
